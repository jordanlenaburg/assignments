    <div class="content">

        <p>"We are really excited to offer this opportunity to our feline friends," says <span class="bold">Bob Ziroll</span>, Lead Instructor at V School. "We really think cats are the future of coding. I personally interview every student before they are accepted to V School, so I see the raw talent each person offers. These cats are <span class="italic">amazing</span>!"</p>
        <p>While it remains to be seen if V School's new policy is crazy or genius, it is certianlly attracting a lot of attention. "You've got to give them credit for innovation," said <span class="bold">Mark Anthony</span> of DevPoint Labs, a competing school.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether or not the felines pass the course, one thing will always remain true: Cats rule the internet.</p>
